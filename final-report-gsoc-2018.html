<h1>GSOC 2018 Summary</h1>
<p>This summer I focused primarily on improvements to the PyMC3 Gaussian process
module.  These items include support for multiple observations, additional
capabilities for larger data sets, a "Latent" Kronecker implementation, and
additional supporting documentation and in-depth examples.</p>
<p>Currently, the Latent Kronecker implementation is ready to merge pending a
final review.  All tests are passing and the example runs smoothly.  The pull
request is <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pull/3065">here</a>, with the demo
<a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/blob/c04b94e1144707fb188bf3469a59330e01463580/docs/source/notebooks/GP-Kron.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
<p>I added an <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pull/3057">in-depth tutorial on GP modeling by extending model of the textbook
example "Mauna Loa" data set</a> to
include ice core data.  This example describes some of the advanced modeling
that can be done with PyMC3 and the GP library, such as custom mean and
covariance functions, GPs with uncertain inputs and complex kernel design.  I
incorporated feedback from a scientist who works in the area, with whom I
connected by one of the core PyMC3 developers.  Some cosmetic tweaks are
required before merge.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pull/3017">multiple observations
functionality</a> proved more
challenging.  The original design of the GP testing suite compared GP
implementations to the base, un-approximated GP implementation in PyMC3.  Since
all of the tests essentially depend on each other, adjusting the functionality
of one implementation causes a large number, sometimes nearly all, of the tests
to fail.  In order to solve this, <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pull/3118">I went through several iterations
refactoring the GP testing suite</a>
until I found an approach such that all tests both demonstrate correctness of
the implementation, and are independent.  The downside is that the tests run 
much slower.</p>
<p>Another focus was on GP implementations for larger data sets.  Since doing
further research, I've somewhat cooled on the idea of inducing-point based
variational approximations.  The pros of these implementations are that
(through minibatching the data) they can scale to data with millions of points
and they require no special structure in the space of independent variables.
However, they require the likelihood to be input to the GP constructor, which
clashes with the flexibility that's fundamental to PyMC3.  If one needs to make
such a specialized and "GP-only" model, they are likely better off using a GP
only library that's devoted to such specializations.  Also, inducing-point
models perform best on data sets where the underlying GP has longer relative
lengthscales.  Data where shorter length variation are just as common, and here,
inducing point methods often fall short.  </p>
<p>I've prototyped a working implementation of a basic Latent inducing point model
before GSOC started (Marginal is already finished).  This was picked up and 
submitted as a PR by someone else, but may have been abandoned and is not yet 
merged.  I intend to reach out and possibly complete it if the other person is
not interested.  After seeing a Stan implementation, I have done some research
into Nearest Neighbor Gaussian processes (NNGP), which may be a better fit for
PyMC3.  It appears very effective for spatial modeling, far more so than
inducing point based approximations.  Potential problems are that it requires
the use of Theano's "scan" function, and adds a very large number of small
covariance matrices to the computational graph, which may cause memory
issues, negating it's ability to fulfill its purpose of handling large data sets.</p>
<p>I also spent some time exploring PyMC4, which will have as similar a syntax as
possible to PyMC3, but use a different backend for autodifferentiation.  Mostly
for my own learning, and as an exercise in thinking about design, I made a
working proof-of-concept using HIPS/autograd (the dynamic graph numpy backend).
My goal is for the design to be completely uncoupled from the backend, such
that it could be used with either static and dynamic graph backends.  In order
to test this out, I intend to get this to also work with a static graph.</p>
